    <p>Due to a recent (and massive) failure on my part while taking a code test for a remote company I had been interested in working for, I have decided to finally take the time to sit down and play around with React/Redux.</p>

    <h3>What is CoinLurk?</h3>
    <p>Well.. what does it sound like? CoinLurk is a simple cryptocurrency price tracking web application. I had decided that I needed to make something interesting if I'm going to learn how to use Redux and crypto fit the bill. I was already an ethusiast, may as well make something that could turn out to be actually useful, right?</p>
    <p>The night I had decided on building out the web app I had been feeling rather low (due to the complete failure of knowing anything about Redux and having had to participate in a code tes that was ENTIRELY Redux..). When I'm feeling low I do what any other sensible American does. I buy something useless. As soon as coinlurk.io was locked down I set out for the deep dive into YouTube videos.</p>
    <p><em>For the record, I really liked <a href="https://youtu.be/93p3LxR9xfM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> by Traversy Media</em></p>

    <h3>So.. How's it going?</h3>
    <p>Well, it's definitely going. It takes a while to really hash out what goes on behind the scenes of a React/Redux app, but once you get it, you pretty much get it. I'm definitely no Redux expert now, but I feel as though I could build with/around it in a comfortable enough way. Other folks that complain about lots of boilerplate just to get it working are ABSOLUTELY right, though. It's a lot. But it's scalable, and now I see why bigger companies like it so much.</p>
    <p>I've only just recently got CoinLurk to be pretty enough to show on the Instagram feed, but there's plenty more in store for it. Once the full functionality and most of the design is done I know I'll probably have some fun with my favorite animation library for React, <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Spring</a>.</p>
    <p>While I continue to build the rest of it out &mdash; go ahead and enjoy these screenshots.</p>
